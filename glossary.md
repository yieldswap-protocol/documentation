## AMM

Automated Market Maker, a smart contract facilitating token or yield exchange in
an automated and trustless way between two parties.

## Notional

The total amount used to calculate settlement payments. Before users can trade
the given notional size they must pledge sufficient collateral in their margin
accounts. The collateral amount is always smaller than the notional, providing
users with leverage and thus greater capital efficiency.

## Payer

Payer is one of the counterparties of a yield swap paying the agreed upon fixed
yield after the tenor. Payers are "long yield".

## Receiver

Receiver is one of the counterparties of a yield swap paying the actually
realized floating yield after the tenor. Receivers are "short yield".

## Tenor

Tenor is the amount of time it takes for a financial contract to expires. A
yield swap tenor of 10 days means that it takes 10 days for the given yield swap
to mature.
