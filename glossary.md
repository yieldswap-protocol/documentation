# Glossary

## AMM

Automated Market Maker, a smart contract facilitating token or yield exchange in
an automated and trustless way between two parties.

## Derivative

A derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an
underlying instrument. Such an instrument might be the pure interest rate of an
asset.

## Future Contract

A futures contract is a bilateral agreement to buy or sell a particular asset at
a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. The buyer (seller) of a
futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy (sell) and receive (deliver)
the underlying asset when the futures contract expires.

## Notional

The total amount used to calculate settlement payments. Before users can trade
the given notional size they must pledge sufficient collateral in their margin
accounts. The collateral amount is always smaller than the notional, providing
users with leverage and thus greater capital efficiency.

## Payer

Payer is one of the counterparties of a yield swap paying the agreed upon fixed
yield after the tenor. Payers are "long yield".

## Receiver

Receiver is one of the counterparties of a yield swap paying the actually
realized floating yield after the tenor. Receivers are "short yield".

## Settlement

Settlement is the delivery of an asset to complete a trade.

## Tenor

Tenor is the duration of a financial contract. A yield swap tenor of 10 days
means that it takes 10 days for the given yield swap to mature.
