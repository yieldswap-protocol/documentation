# Receivers

Receivers pay the floating interest rate of an asset over a given tenor. In
exchange for their floating interest rate Receivers receive the fixed interest
rate provided by Payers. A receiver swap is therefore a bet on higher fixed
interest rates over the given tenor. Receivers can speculate on underperforming
market conditions compared to the guaranteed fixed interest rate of an asset.
