# Introduction

## What is Yield Swap?

Yield Swap is a DEX for capital efficient [interest rate swaps]. These kind of
derivatives let users exchange fixed yields for floating yields, and vice versa.
Where [UniSwap] enables users to exchange digital assets like ETH, Yield Swap
enables users to exchange pure yields of interest rates themselves. The Yield
Swap users engaging in interest rate swaps are called [Payers] and [Receivers].

## What problem does Yield Swap solve?

Lending markets and yield farming protocols have gained great popularity across
DeFi and attracted substantial amounts of liquidity. Despite their great
success, arguably all investment hypothesis bear risks and high volatility. The
problem DeFi users are exposed to is a lack of hedging instruments against
volatility and a lack of secondary markets to take advantage of it. So the
problem Yield Swap tries to solve is to provide DeFi users with a platform to
hedge against and bet on volatility across decentralized asset classes, all the
while being most capital efficient.
