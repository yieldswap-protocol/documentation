# Introduction

## What is Yield Swap?

Yield Swap is a decentralized exchange that allows users to swap interest rates.
Users exchanging interest rates on Yield Swap are called [Payers](./payers.md)
and [Receivers](./receivers.md). Payers pay the fixed interest rate of an asset
in exchange for the floating interest rate provided by Receivers. Both user
types do this in order to make a profit based on their respective investment
strategies.

## What problem does Yield Swap solve?

Lending markets and yield farming protocols have gained great popularity across
DeFi and attracted substantial amounts of liquidity. Despite their great
success, arguably all investment hypothesis bear risks and high volatility. The
problem DeFi users are exposed to is a lack of hedging instruments against
volatility and a lack of secondary markets to take advantage of it. So the
problem Yield Swap tries to solve is to provide DeFi users with a platform to
hedge against and bet on volatility across decentralized asset classes, all the
while being most capital efficient.
