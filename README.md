# Introduction

## What is Yield Swap?

Yield Swap is a DEX for capital efficient [interest rate swaps]. These kind of
derivatives let users exchange fixed yields for floating yields, and vice versa.
Where [UniSwap] enables users to exchange digital assets like ETH, Yield Swap
enables users to exchange pure yields of interest rates themselves. The Yield
Swap users engaging in interest rate swaps are called [Payers] and [Receivers].

## What problem does Yield Swap solve?

The problem DeFi users are exposed to is a lack of hedging instruments against
yield volatility and a lack of secondary markets to take advantage of it. So the
problem Yield Swap tries to solve is to provide DeFi users with a platform to
transfer yield risks across decentralized asset classes, all the while being
most capital efficient. With Yield Swap DeFi users can speculate on yield
changes and hedge their yield exposure.
