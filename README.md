# Introduction

## What is Yield Swap?

Yield Swap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for capital efficient [interest rate swaps]. These kind of derivatives let users exchange fixed yields for floating yields, and vice versa. Where [UniSwap] enables users to exchange digital assets like ETH, Yield Swap enables users to exchange pure yields of interest rates themselves. The [Yield Swap] users engaging in interest rate swaps are called Payers and Receivers.

## What problem does Yield Swap solve?

DeFi users are exposed to high volatility and they lack hedging instruments to reduce their risks as well as a secondary markets to take advantage of volatile markets. Yield Swap solves this problem by providing a platform with an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to transfer yield risks across decentralized asset classes while being most capital efficient. With the Yield Swap protocol, DeFi users can speculate on yield changes and hedge their yield exposure.
