# Payers

Payers pay the fixed interest rate of an asset over a given tenor. In exchange
for their fixed interest rate Payers receive the floating interest rate provided
by Receivers. A payer swap is therefore a bet on higher floating interest rates
over the given tenor. Payers can speculate on overperforming market conditions
compared to the guaranteed fixed interest rate of an asset.
